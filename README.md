## Key Words: PRIM, Dijkstra

I exercised a code challenge problem of Minimum Spanning Trees in PRIM, the Shortest Path in Dijkstra: as I said in other projects,
  I had set the time limit for doing each implementation that is, in this case, **20 min**.
  I wanted to experiment with several avenues, but I could NOT yet spare more time than 20 min because of other important tasks that I need to finish first.

I found that doing anything in a limited time, in a self-controlled manner is enjoyable and profitable to hone my skills.
Therefore, there is a lot of room to improve this code that is a disclaimer to this project.

If I can spare more, I'll revisit this and add more examples of or ways of MST.

And it is based on the Minimum Priority Queue which I've created previously and also which can be found in https://github.com/shrewdacumen/MinHeap-MaxHeap-PriorityQueues-in-Swift5

Again, this project is not final.

## List of algorithms
- Minimum spanning tree in PRIM algorithm, a Greedy Algorithm
- Minimum spanning tree in PRIM algorithm using Minimum Priority Queue.
- Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, Adjacency Matrix Representation, Greedy Algorithm
